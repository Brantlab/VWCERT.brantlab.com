## How We Work

The **Van Wert County Community Emergency Response Team (CERT)** operates as a volunteer resource to support emergency services and the community during incidents, planned events, and times of need.

### Dispatch & Activation

Our team may be activated through:

- **Van Wert County Sheriff’s Department**
- **Van Wert Police Department**
- **Van Wert County Emergency Management Agency (EMA)**
- Or by direct request through **CERT Chairman Matt Saunier** or **EMA Director Rick McCoy**

When requested, CERT members are notified via our internal alerting system and respond based on availability and assignment.

### What We Do

CERT provides trained volunteer support across a variety of missions, including:

- **Traffic Control:** Assisting law enforcement and fire services at crash scenes, fires, or public events to maintain safety and access.  
- **Canteen Operations:** Supplying water, food, and cooling or warming stations for first responders and displaced residents.  
- **Search & Volunteer Coordination:** Assisting in organizing and deploying volunteers during missing-person searches or community recovery efforts.  
- **Case Work & Community Assistance:** Working with affected families after incidents such as fires or storms to connect them with essential resources and recovery support.  
- **Public Outreach & Education:** Supporting preparedness events, safety fairs, and training to help residents be ready before emergencies happen.

### Our Role

CERT operates under the direction of the **Van Wert County EMA** and in coordination with local public-safety agencies. Our goal is to enhance community resilience, supplement first responders, and provide compassionate support to those impacted by emergencies.
