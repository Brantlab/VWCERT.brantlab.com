Losing a home can be devastating. We at CERT want you to know that we are here for you in the event a disaster strikes, and you need assistance. Over the last 2 years we have been involved with several families who have dealt with tragedy and, fortunately, had a community to turn to in their time of need. With partners from the Salvation Army, Van Wert County Foundation and The United Way, CERT is able to provide immediate assistance to those families. Through donations, the community of Van Wert has been a tremendous asset for affect families, and they have been forever grateful.
