When emergencies arise, responders push their limits to serve the community. Our **CERT** Rehab Unit is here to ensure those responders stay safe, healthy, and ready to perform. We provide essential support services to firefighters, EMTs, police officers, and volunteers during extended operations or extreme conditions.
